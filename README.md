# 🧠 Neuro Imaging Analysis and Research (NIAR)

## Project Title
**Identifying Disease-Related Changes in Brain Activity Combinig Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Machine Learning**

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI)** data to identify **biomarkers of neurological diseases**. By comparing brain network activity between patients and healthy controls, we aim to discover patterns that signal early signs of disease and model their progression over time.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze rs-fMRI data to detect abnormal connectivity patterns.
- Use graph-based brain network analysis to identify potential biomarkers.
- Apply machine learning to distinguish between healthy and diseased brain activity.
- Evaluate biomarker stability and disease progression using longitudinal scans.
